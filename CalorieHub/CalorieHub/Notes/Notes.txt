1. Main idea
// build app that allows users to track the type and amount of calories eaten each day

// initially ask user to store their height and weight, and their goal calories
// incorporate health kit to track steps
// track hours fasted

// add an onboarding view 

1a. Foods - users can edit, delete, etc foods for each day.
    each day should show a list of foods and the calories. create data models
    datamodel: calories (required), macros/micros (optionals), vitamins, key nutrients, date created
    
    1. Calorie + food / health app - practice navigation stack, navigation link/dest, lists, SwiftData, health kit
    1. Make custom tab view 
    
1b. Fasting - users should input how many hours they fasted and when they broke their fast
    
1c. Steps/health - incorporate health kit to read user's nutrition, calories but also allow health kit to
    write to the app indicating steps taken and calories burned
    // mayb retrieve data from health kit to display it as a chart  (steps, calories)



HealthKit :
1. Classes/Methods used :
1a. HKSample(HKQuantitySample), HKObjectType(HKQuantityType), and HKQuantity
2. Healthstore, authorizationStatus, requestAuthorization


Great writeup for swiftdata and populating containers : https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/blog/ios-development/data-persistence/pre-populate-swiftdata-persistent-store/

Known issues in #PREVIEW:
1. Populating #Preview with sample swift data :
    - Solved using an external preview which created a sample model container with data
    - Can't seem to populate more than 1 Model in a container. My Food model works, but trying to incorporate the UserGoals model crashes in preview
